      <item value="Used to reverse item traversal and layout order. This behaves similar to the layout change for RTL views. When set to true, first item is laid out at the end of the UI, second item is laid out before it etc." />

      <item value="Returns an estimate of the bitmap heap memory usage for this RemoteViews." />
      <item value="As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the Java&amp;trade; programming language.)" />
      <item value="&lt;li&gt;If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)} method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. &lt;li&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;em&gt; required that if two objects are unequal according to the {@link java.lang.Objectequals(java.lang.Object)} method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables." />
      <item value="&lt;li&gt;Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application." />
      <item value="Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by" />
      <item value="If the request is completed, beginning again will ensure the result is re-delivered, triggering RequestListeners and Targets. If the request is failed, beginning again will restart the request, giving it another chance to complete. If the request is already running, we can let it continue running without interruption." />
      <item value="We only store a bitmap cache in the root of the RemoteViews." />

      <item value="Because pruning can remove the need for bitmaps, we reconstruct the bitmap cache" />

      <item value="We only write the bitmap cache if we are the root RemoteViews, as this cache is shared by all children." />
