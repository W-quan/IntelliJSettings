      <item value="&lt;!-- Controls whether a view can take focus. By default, this is &quot;auto&quot; which lets the framework determine whether a user can move focus to a view.

This value does not impact the behavior of directly calling {@link android.view.ViewrequestFocus}, which will always request focus regardless of this view. It only impacts where focus navigation will try to move focus. --&gt;" />

      <item value="If the field type is {@code long} or {@code int} (or its TypeConverter converts it to a {@code long} or {@code int}), {@link Insert} methods treat {@code 0} as not-set while inserting the item." />

      <item value="Each {@link Entity} must declare a primary key unless one of its super classes declares a primary key. If both an {@link Entity} and its super class defines a {@code PrimaryKey}, the child's {@code PrimaryKey} definition will override the parent's {@code PrimaryKey}." />

      <item value="Normally, an ObservableSource that returns multiple items will do so by invoking its {@link Observer}'s {@link ObserveronNext onNext} method for each such item. You can change this behavior, instructing the ObservableSource to compose a list of all of these items and then to invoke the Observer's {@code onNext} function once, passing it the entire list, by calling the ObservableSource's {@code toList} method prior to calling its {@link subscribe} method." />
