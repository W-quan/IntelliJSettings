      <item value="layout Chunk" />
      <item value="This case relates to when the anchor child is the focused view and due to layout shrinking the focused view fell outside the viewport, e.g. when soft keyboard shows up after tapping an EditText which shrinks RV causing the focused view (The tapped EditText which is the anchor child) to get kicked out of the screen. Will update the anchor coordinate in order to make sure that the focused view is laid out. Otherwise, the available space in layoutState will be calculated as negative preventing the focused view from being laid out in fill. Note that we won't update the anchor position between layout passes (refer to TestResizingRelayoutWithAutoMeasure), which happens if we were to call updateAnchorInfoForLayout for an anchor that's not the focused view (e.g. a reference child which can change between layout passes)." />
      <item value="calculate anchor position and coordinate" />
      <item value="Type checking has run into a recursive problem. Easiest workaround: specify types of your declarations explicitly¡" />
      <item value="This means that the View was a child of the LayoutManager when layout started but has been removed by the LayoutManager. It might have been removed from the adapter or simply become invisible due to other factors. You can distinguish these two cases by checking the change flags that were passed to" />

      <item value="Represents a property, such as a named `val` or `var` declaration. Instances of this class are obtainable by the `::` operator. See the [Kotlin language documentation](https:kotlinlang.orgdocsreferencereflection.html) for more information." />

      <item value="Returns the index of the child to draw for this iteration. Override this if you want to change the drawing order of children. By default, it returns i." />
      <item value="It works using the {@link ViewGroupgetChildDrawingOrder(int, int)} method, so any case that applies to that method also applies to this callback. For example, changing the drawing order of two views will not have any effect if their elevation values are different since elevation overrides the result of this callback." />

      <item value="Returns a reversed read-only view of the original List. All changes made in the original list will be reflected in the reversed one." />
      <item value="Used to reverse item traversal and layout order. This behaves similar to the layout change for RTL views. When set to true, first item is laid out at the end of the UI, second item is laid out before it etc." />
      <item value="Generally this method should be used for scaling and translating view item for better (different) view presentation of layouting." />
